# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

## Overview

Genius Cleaner is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed with privacy as a core principle - we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No cookies or tracking mechanisms
- No data is sent to external servers

## Local Storage

The extension stores your preferences locally using Chrome's built-in storage API:

- **Settings:** Your toggle preferences (what to hide/show) are stored locally in your browser
- **Sync:** If you're signed into Chrome, your settings may sync across your devices through Chrome's built-in sync feature

This data never leaves your browser except through Chrome's own sync mechanism if enabled.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **genius.com:** To modify the Genius website's appearance by hiding elements
- **storage:** To save your preferences locally
- **activeTab:** To apply settings to the current Genius tab

## Third Parties

Genius Cleaner does not share data with any third parties because we do not collect any data in the first place. The extension operates entirely within your browser.

## Open Source

Genius Cleaner is open source. You can review the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/user/genius-cleaner) to verify our privacy practices.

## Changes

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
